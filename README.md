## Space Invaders 
The game was written as a C++ programming project. The aim of the project was to demonstrate knowledge of object-oriented programming, clean code principles and the use of pointers.

The game contains 4 different types of opponents. Each of them contains different features. Enemies are automatically respawned every certain amount of time. The system for detecting collisions and the position of ammunition and rivals optimally manages memory, removing unnecessary elements. The player's ship reacts to hits received - health points are subtracted and the appearance of the player's ship changes.
